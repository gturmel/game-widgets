## Overview:

I really like playing games. I was at a game night recently, and realized that there's a lot of RNG-related needs. From Risk to Monopoly to various stat trackers, there's a need for a variety of RNG generation/dice simulators. I also think it'd be neat to build some of this stuff, it sounds like a fun technical challenge. I'm going to start with a Risk roller, and move on from there.
